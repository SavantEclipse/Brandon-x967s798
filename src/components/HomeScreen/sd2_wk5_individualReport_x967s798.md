for week 5 after the restructure of our team I was assigned to learn more about react and watch the first 12 of the tutorial videos on 

https://www.codebreakthrough.com/view/courses/free-react-course/1469975-default-section/4582491-1-intro-to-react-react-tutorial-1

I haven't made any commits to the projects code this week. 

This week we assigned tasks to ourselves and each other in Trello. We planned to contact our sponsor, contact our professor for clarification of the term prototype, to re-balance responsibilities due to a change in our group size, and lastly I was to begin planning systems to process the menu information. 

I will have more technical work to present on the following individual reports.
